# Updated

Switched over to use Javascript modules. This means you can:

- Organize your files
- Use ES6 import and export syntax
- Create easier to grok and DRYer code
- Can **NOT** run your files on your computer without some form of server

The fix for the last one is just using a basic server to serve it. The good thing about this is that it will also auto refresh whenever you hit save. It have recommended the extension when you booted, but if not:

- `cmd + shift + p`
- Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions

That will show you the `Live Server` extension. After it as been added you will see "Go Live" at the bottom right of your VSCode. Click it.

I would recommend using this for all local static sites.

## Homework

- Just read the code and get a feel for what is going on.
- contribute to it in the same style.
